Visualization of Employment and Illiteracy Rates amongst major religious groups in India


This is the interactive visualization for the analysis of inequality prevailing amongst major religious groups in India (Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism). Here, we try to visualise the employment rates and the illiteracy rates among these religious groups in particularly 4 dimensions - Rural Female , Rural Male , Urban Male and Urban Female. By adding these dimensions we get better and deeper insights into the data we are visualizing.

The interesting thing about the graphical representation is that it shows 5 variables at a single glance:
1. Religion
2. Illiteracy Rates
3. Labour Participation Rates
4. Gender Split
5. Urban-Rural Split
